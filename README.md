# My Webapp

This is my personal site, which I use to show my portfolio. You can access it by [clicking on here](https://gaoliver.github.io/my-webapp/#/).

## Clonning the project

To clone this repo, you need to use the `git clone`, just like:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaoliver/my-webapp.git
```

## Running the project

For this, you will need to enter the project folder, on terminal, and then run `yarn`. This command is going to install all the dependencies.

Then you can run

```bash
yarn start
```

And this is going to start the project and open the application on the browser.
