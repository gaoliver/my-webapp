          I am Frontend and Mobile Developer - with some few experiences as
          Fullstack - since 2018, always searching for learning new languages
          and frameworks, like React and React Native (which ones I use the most
          today), also C#.NET (which I have used in some big important projects
          for companies, and for learning) and Python (for learning and creating
          data projects in the University, when I was graduating in Physics.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked for Inventa Produtos Digitais, where I was part of many
          projects for companies and even for the government. During that time,
          I worked with Wordpress, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React Native, GIT,
          Redux and C#/.NET.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I got the position as Project Manager and React Native Developer
          at Loomer Tech, where I created many mobile apps for companies and for
          internal projects, using React Native, Azure, Redux, GIT, and
          React.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the middle of the same year, I received an opportunity to be React
          Native Developer at Americanas S.A., the largest international
          e-commerce Company in Latin America. I was hired for working on a
          project of renewing an old app - from scratch - which is used for
          international e-commerce. So I did it, being the main mobile developer
          of the whole project and making it happen. The app is very famous
          around the country until nowadays. For that project, I worked using
          React Native, Redux, AWS, GIT, Jira and everything needed to learn,
          for making a better work everyday.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of 2021, I received an opportunity that changed my whole
          life. I was hired for (starting in 2022) working as Frontend Developer
          at Dept Agency, in Rotterdam, Netherlands. This is my current Company,
          and I work in many important projects for huge companies from all
          around the world, as Dept is one of the greatest marketing companies
          in the world. And as Frontend Developer, I work a lot on web
          development using React.js and learning the most I can to improve
          every project.
        </p>
        <p>
          P.S.: During the time I was studying Physics at the University, I was
          part of Rio de Janeiro Rocket Team (GFRJ), an extracurricular
          scientific group for building rockets for national and international
          competitions. Working on it, I was the developer of payload systems,
          in Python. We got #1 as Best Rocket, in Brazil, and #3 in an
          international compatition called Spaceport American Cup, in the USA,
          in the category of Best Solid Motor Rocket.
