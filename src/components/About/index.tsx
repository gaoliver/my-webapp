        <h1>About me</h1>
        {/* Introduction */}
        <p>My name is Gabriel Ramos üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª. I am Brazilian üáßüá∑.</p>
        {/* The text body */}
        <p>
          I started programming when I was 14 years-old. When I received my
          first computer, it was something really impressive to me. While my
          friends were getting amazed by social networks and games, I was amazed
          by trying to understand how were those things done.
        </p>
        <p>
          I still remember my first Informatics Teacher. After totaly basic
          classes, learning only how to use Microsoft Office package, I asked
          her how to create a website. And she got surprised for a 10 years-old
          boy asking for learning more about something not necessary for the
          class. Then I got an afterclass time with her, alone in the lab, to
          study the basics of HTML and CSS. That was my very kickstart.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my 14{"'"}s, I was already coding my own websites and learning more
          of PHP and JavaScript. So, in High School, I codded NerdLine website,
          an online newspaper about pop culture, comic books, movies and games,
          where I used to work on with my friends. The project had a
          administration portal, for creating the posts. I was the responsible
          for all the front-end and back-end development. The only coder of the
          entire project. Some time later, I started using Wordpress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since that time, I{"'"}m learning always more about programming, new
          languages and frameworks, like React and React Native (which ones I
          use the most today), also C#.NET (which I have used in some big
          important projects for companies, and for learning) and Python (for
          learning and creating data projects in the University, when I was
          graduating in Physics.)
        </p>
        <p>
          During this time, studying Physics at the University, I was part of
          Rio de Janeiro Rocket Team, an extracurricular scientific group for
          building rockets for national and international competitions. Working
          on it, I was the developer of payload systems, in Python. We got #1 as
          Best Rocket, in Brazil, and #3 as Best Solid Motor Rocket, at
          Spaceport American Cup, in the USA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I{"'"}m a front-end developer, experienced on being the main
          front-end of many web and mobile projects. I based all my experience
          focused on that position, which I enjoy the most and improve myself
          every day. The achievement of my professional life is staying ahead of
          many important projects and being known in development field as an
          important developer, for my knowledge and the results of my jobs.

          <p>
            Front-end is the best stack for me, where I became professional
            into. This is where we connect the user to the application and data,
            and make all the programming logic.
