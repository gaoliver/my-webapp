          I am Frontend and Mobile Developer - with some few experiences as
          Fullstack - since 2018, always searching for learning new languages and
          frameworks, like React and React Native (which ones
          I use the most today), also C#.NET (which I have used in some big
          important projects for companies, and for learning) and Python (for
          learning and creating data projects in the University, when I was
          graduating in Physics.)
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked for Inventa Produtos Digitais, where I was part of many
          projects for companies and even for the government. During that time,
          I worked with Wordpress, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React Native, GIT,
          Redux and C#/.NET.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then I got the position as Project Manager and React Native Developer at
          Loomer Tech, where I created many mobile apps for companies and for
          internal projects, using React Native, Azure, Redux, GIT, and
          React.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the middle of the same year, I received an opportunity to be React
          Native Developer at Americanas S.A., the largest international
          e-commerce Company in Latin America. I was hired for working on a
          project of renewing an old app - from scratch - which is used for international
          e-commerce. So I did it, being the main mobile developer of the whole project
          and making it happen. The app is very famous around the country until nowadays.
          For that project, I worked using React Native, Redux, AWS, GIT, Jira and everything
          needed to learn, for making a better work everyday.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of 2021, I received an opportunity that changed my whole life.
          I was hired for (starting in 2022) working as Frontend Developer at
          Dept Agency, in Rotterdam, Netherlands. This is my current Company, and
          I work in many important projects for huge companies from all around
          the world, as Dept is one of the greatest marketing companies in the world.
          And as Frontend Developer, I work a lot on web development using React.js
          and learning the most I can to improve every project.
        </p>
        <p>
          P.S.: During the time I was studying Physics at the University, I was part of
          Rio de Janeiro Rocket Team (GFRJ), an extracurricular scientific group for
          building rockets for national and international competitions. Working
          on it, I was the developer of payload systems, in Python. We got #1 as
          Best Rocket, in Brazil, and #3 in an international compatition called
          Spaceport American Cup, in the USA, in the category of Best Solid Motor Rocket.
